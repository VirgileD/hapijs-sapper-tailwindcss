# A sapper/tailwindcss frontend

Based upon the [Sapper Rollup Template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template-rollup) so it uses [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) as a bundler
TailwindCss has been added as a way to sytilish rendereing.

## Getting started

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Of course without the backend, you wont go far as the root page is a login.

## Directory structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project —  `src` and `static`.


### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app — `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` — along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.


#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes — *pages*, and *server routes*.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)

**Server routes** are modules written in `.js` files, that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods. Each function receives Express `request` and `response` objects as arguments, plus a `next` function. This is useful for creating a JSON API, for example.

There are three simple rules for naming the files that define your routes:

* A file called `src/routes/about.svelte` corresponds to the `/about` route. A file called `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` corresponds to the `/blog/:slug` route, in which case `params.slug` is available to the route
* The file `src/routes/index.svelte` (or `src/routes/index.js`) corresponds to the root of your app. `src/routes/about/index.svelte` is treated the same as `src/routes/about.svelte`.
* Files and directories with a leading underscore do *not* create routes. This allows you to colocate helper modules and components with the routes that depend on them — for example you could have a file called `src/routes/_helpers/datetime.js` and it would *not* create a `/_helpers/datetime` route.


#### src/node_modules/images

Images added to `src/node_modules/images` can be imported into your code using `import 'images/<filename>'`. They will be given a dynamically generated filename containing a hash, allowing for efficient caching and serving the images on a CDN.

#### src/node_modules/@sapper

This directory is managed by Sapper and generated when building. It contains all the code you import from `@sapper` modules.


### static

The [static](static) directory contains static assets that should be served publicly. Files in this directory will be available directly under the root URL, e.g. an `image.jpg` will be available as `/image.jpg`.

The default [service-worker.js](src/service-worker.js) will preload and cache these files, by retrieving a list of `files` from the generated manifest:

```js
import { files } from '@sapper/service-worker';
```

If you have static files you do not want to cache, you should exclude them from this list after importing it (and before passing it to `cache.addAll`).

Static files are served using [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).


## Bundler configuration

Sapper uses Rollup to provide code-splitting and dynamic imports, as well as compiling your Svelte components.


## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. 


## Using external components

When using Svelte components installed from npm, such as [@sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list), Svelte needs the original component source (rather than any precompiled JavaScript that ships with the component). This allows the component to be rendered server-side, and also keeps your client-side app smaller.

Because of that, it's essential that the bundler doesn't treat the package as an *external dependency*. You can either modify the `external` option under `server` in [rollup.config.js](rollup.config.js), or simply install the package to `devDependencies` rather than `dependencies`, which will cause it to get bundled (and therefore compiled) with your app:

```bash
npm install -D @sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list
```


## Bugs and feedback

Sapper is in early development, and may have the odd rough edge here and there. Please be vocal over on the [Sapper issue tracker](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues).
